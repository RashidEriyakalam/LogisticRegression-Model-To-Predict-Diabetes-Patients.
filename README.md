# LogisticRegression-Model-To-Predict-Diabetes-Patients.
In this project, a logistic regression model was developed to predict diabetes patients using patient data sourced from the Health Facts database. This comprehensive dataset includes patient demographics, clinical features, and encounter details from hospitals across the United States, with a specific emphasis on diabetes-related information. The model's objective is early detection, allowing for timely intervention and improved healthcare outcomes for individuals at risk of diabetes, thereby contributing to more effective patient care and management in the healthcare system.
