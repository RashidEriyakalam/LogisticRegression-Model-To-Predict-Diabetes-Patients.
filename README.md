# Diabetes Patient Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on the development of a logistic regression model to predict diabetes patients using patient data from the Health Facts database. The dataset comprises comprehensive clinical records from hospitals across the United States, with a specific emphasis on diabetes-related information.

## Data Overview

The dataset used for this analysis contains a wide range of patient data, including demographics, clinical features, and encounter details. Key attributes include gender, age, medical specialty, lab tests, medications, and diabetes-related indicators.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Thorough exploration of the dataset to understand the data structure and variables.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning were performed on the data set to increase the efficiency of the prediction.

3. **Logistic Regression Model**: A logistic regression model was developed to predict diabetes patients based on patient data and diabetes-related indicators.

4. **Scaling**: As the scaling methods affect model performace significantly, so in upcoming code we are exploring various scaling methods for our base model LogisticRegression.
   
## Key Objectives.

The project's main Objectives include:

- Cleaning the data and avoid the misleading informations.
- Development of a logistic regression model for diabetes patient prediction.
- Focus on early detection to enhance patient care and management in the healthcare system.

## Tools Used

The primary tool used in this analysis is Python for data preprocessing and logistic regression model development.
